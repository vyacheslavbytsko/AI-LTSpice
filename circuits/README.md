## Circuits simulations in LTSpiceIV

This is my personal collection of circuits simulations in LTSpiceIV. At some point in time I simulated each one of these circuits and analyzed them. Sometimes I'd simulate a circuit we studied in class, other times I tested a theory and/or my understandings of a particular circuit, some other times I'd just simulate a design I found on the internet and other times I'd simulate a circuit I tried to build.

Below you can find a non exhaustive list of the circuits which are included in this repository. All of what is included was written on LTSpiceIV by myself. On some DC-AC converters, a gain module which I did not build myself is used. Since I'm not sure on whether I can upload it here, it is not included.

Some examples:
